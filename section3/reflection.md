## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
Carmen Popoviciu talks about struggling through a computer science degree and feeling a sense that she didn't belong.  This was not the primary reason that I dropped out of CU Boulder while enrolled in their Computer Science program, but it was definitely part of it.  I was about 10 years older that the other students, and I felt like everyone around me had a grasp of the concepts that I was struggling with alone. She discusses her steps to helping herself through the struggle: accepting that she's struggling, making a mental list of what exactly it is that she's struggling with, and then thinking about how she can fix it by making mental action notes and then acting on them.  Sometimes when things become tough, it is easy to feel overwhelmed and give up on the whole process.  By breaking it down into smaller pieces, you can evaluate what parts are the actual problem, and you can set goals to overcome the struggle.

Track your own progress instead of comparing yourself to others.  Some people may need the pressure of competing with others, and some people may need competition to stay motivated, but always look at where you started as the actual gauge of your learning.  I feel like this sort of mindset will be very important for me to adopt, as although I'm not a particularly competitive person, I do find myself, even already in Mod 0 at Turing, listening to other people answer questions in class, and thinking "why don't I sound like them?".  Part of this is in my social anxiety and depression, and it is an all-around issue with myself, not just limited to coding.  

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I do love to learn, and I'm not typically discouraged by hitting roadblocks.  When I do come across a problem, I feel comfortable using google to attempt to find an answer, and I will spend hours searching until I find what will help me solve the problem.  A good example of this was when I built a computer with my son.  We were having an issue that I spent about a week trying to solve.  He wanted me to "give up" and take it somewhere, but I refused, and eventually it just came down to a cord being plugged in in the wrong direction.  It is easy for me to become overwhelmed though, and when I get overwhelmed, panic tends to set in.  As I discussed in the previous question, I definitely have issues with comparing myself to others and how they grasp concepts and how comfortable they are with sharing in front of others.  Part of what I think is a "growth mindset" within me, might also be something that keeps me in a static mindset. There is a fine line between spending hours and hours searching for answers, and deciding that after a certain amount of time, asking for help is the best path forward.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Twitter probably stores all of the comments for an individual tweet within an array.  It would be easy to add new comments and remove ones that the user has deleted. The comments could then be sorted based on the algorithm used to display them for each user who might be viewing the comments.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
Arrays are used store multiple variables so they are easily sorted and searched.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
A loop allows for repeated checking of conditions. If your array was very large and you were searching for something in particular, it would be ideal to use a loop to check each index in the array.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
I would teach a 5 year old about loops by using a car race as an example.  A racecar would drive around the track and every time it passes the finish line it will check to see if it has completed the requisite number of laps, or if it needs to go around again.  It keeps track of the number of laps completed by adding one each time it passes the finish line.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
In my readings, I came across another type of loop, the switch. In the past, I've also used while loops.  I'm curious about implementation of these types and others that we may use!
