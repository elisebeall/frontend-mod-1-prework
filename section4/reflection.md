## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
During the previous pre-work sections, I tried to make sure I was taking breaks to at least go up and down the stairs, step out back and visit my squirrels, and take time to check in with my son, but I wasn't sticking to any sort of particular interval.  Actually keeping track of 25 minutes "on" and 5 minutes "off" really helped keep me on a schedule.  I aimed to get each individual technical work exercise done within the 25-30 minutes, and then had a quick cool down.  I think my focus was improved, and I definitely spent less time checking email, twitter, and reddit.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I mostly answered this in the previous question, but I did find that time passed a lot quicker than I thought.  Although I felt like I was making good time on the exercises, when I actually watched the clock, it was clear that I wasn't as focused as I could be.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An Object is made up of key-pairs which allow organized grouping of related data types.  An Array is a data structure that represents a group of things that are typically of the same data type.  It organizes the data so that it is easily searched and sorted.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    * An array would allow the students to be easily sorted and searched.
  * List of states and their capitals
    * An object would allow a state key to be paired to it's capital.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    * An array would make it easy to add things that needed to be packed and to remove things that had already gone in the suitcase.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    * Arrays would be a good way to store a list of Instagram accounts that have been followed.
  * List of student names and their cohort
    * Objects would makes it easy to pair a student's name with their cohort.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    * Storing individual ingredients paired with their amounts would allow the recipe to be easily doubled or tripled.
  * All my favorite restaurants
    * An array of favorite restaurants would be easy to search, as well as easily added to or removed from.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
I regularly use Denver Health's MyChart to keep track of appointments and refill medications.  Each medication could be stored as an object name for the medication, where the key pairs would be things like date prescription written: 02/01/2021, prescription number: 118390822, last refill date: 02/01/2021, doctor name: Laura Rogers, and number of pills: 30.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
When working on the modZeroHero exercise, I became a little mixed up around the passing of objects keys into classes.  I found myself mixing up the syntax, but I think that as I practice over the next couple weeks before Mod 1, it will become much easier to distinguish.
