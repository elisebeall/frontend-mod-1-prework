## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I am pretty reserved when it comes to asking questions.  I usually feel like if I'm confused about something, someone else is too, and I'll wait to see if anyone else asks.  Another reason I'll wait to ask, is because I feel like instructors will introduce a subject first, and then break it down into smaller pieces and go into more depth.  That will usually clear up some of my confusion.  I probably am somewhere in between as far as question asking timing.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
I enjoyed switching up the method of learning.  Using videos to explore topics is one of my favorite ways to learn, as I like being able to watch what happens when the code is compiled, and how it can be manipulated to get the results desired.  I think requiring us to look through notes or do some googling is good practice for further modules.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
A conditional statement takes different inputs and is able to make decisions and perform different functions based on that variable input.  In my life, before I can go to bed, I need to check to make sure I've brushed my teeth, washed my face, turned out the lights, and plugged in my phone.  If I haven't done one of those things, I can't go to sleep yet.
If I enter my password incorrectly, my bank will send me back to the login screen, but it if is correct, I can look at my accounts.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how the program reads them and determines what to do.
When the program reads an 'if' statement, it looks at the condition(s) and will make sure that it evaluates to true.  If one or any of the statements are false, then the program is given an 'else' statement to evaluate.  If there are many possible outcomes, the program uses 'else if' statements to evaluate these other options.  The 'else' statement is a catch-all statement that will evaluate no matter what conditions have evaluated to false.  The 'else if' statements are there to give more paths for the program to follow.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
To check that two conditions are met, a developer can use the AND ('&&') conditional.  To check if one of two conditions are met the developer can use the OR ('||') conditional.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
I feel really solid on 'if' statements as this is something I learned in high school and have been using in many college classes as well as practicing when helping my son with his computer science homework.
